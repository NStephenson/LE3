# Bug Fixes 

Students need to be removed from unresponded chats if their tab is closed.


# Feature additions

1. Dispatch mode: Users can hold shift while the page is loading to open the page in dispatch mode. This will cause ALL tabs in RA and Active to automatically open their tabs

2. Update notification: A small window will open when I update the app to notifiy users of an update when expertchat is openend. Will have minor update notes and link to a full patch note window 

3. Text Autofill: Certain elements will fill automatically, such as the students name and zoom links

4. Boilerplate text: For things that are often repeated, a boilerplate text window will appear.
